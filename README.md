# Food Finder Website 

## Description

This website takes a search query from the user and will find restaurants and recipes related to it. This can help make it easier for users to decide whether they want to eat out or make their favorite dish at home.

We wanted to use 2 different server-side APIs, Google Maps/Places API and Edamam API. Google Maps would be used to search for local restaurants and provide autocomplete when searching for locations. Edamam provides recipes and their details such as the ingredients, calorie count, and the link to the original location of the recipe.

The user can bookmark their favorite recipes/restaurants and look at them in the bookmarks menu. Clicking on the bookmark link from the menu will move to the "details" page for that respective recipe/restaurant. The bookmarks are stored in the browser's local storage.
